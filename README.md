# Ecommerce-Sales-Analysis
 This project simulates an E-commerce Sales Analysis workflow. The dataset contains customer, order, product, and sales information. I used SQL for querying and analysis. The goal is to extract insights about sales performance, customer behavior, and product performance, and present them in a dashboard for business stakeholders.
